# B2B-couriers-charges-analysis
In this project, we aim to analyze B2B courier charges using Python, providing insights into the cost structures and optimizing expenses related to business-to-business (B2B) logistics. 

The analysis of B2B courier charges accuracy centers on evaluating the precision of fees imposed by courier companies for the transportation of goods in Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions. The objective is to verify that companies are invoiced accurately for the services rendered by courier companies. 

ABC Company, an e-commerce platform, manages a substantial volume of daily orders. To fulfill these orders, ABC collaborates with various courier companies in India, which determine charges based on the weight of the products and the distance between ABC's warehouse and the customer's delivery address. ABC's objective is to verify the accuracy of the fees billed by the courier companies for each individual order. ABC wants to analyze the accuracy of the fees charged by the courier company.
